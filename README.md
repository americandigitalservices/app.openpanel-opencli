# OpenCLI  

OpenCLI is the command-line interface for managing [OpenPanel](https://openpanel.com/).  

On installation, the `opencli.sh` script is added to the system path, and `commands.sh` generates a list of all commands to be included in `.bashrc` for autocomplete.  

All scripts from `/usr/local/opencli/` can be accessed using the `opencli` command by replacing `/` with `-`.  

For example: running `opencli user-add` executes `/usr/bin/opencli` and passes `user-add` as an argument, triggering the execution of the `user/add` script from the scripts directory.

## Updates

OpenPanel is proud of the modularity, so you can independently update just the OpenCLI when needed.

To update OpenCLI:

```sh
cd /usr/local/opencli && git pull
```
